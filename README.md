# Programming Basics
Materials used to teach basic programming concepts.

Code can be tested/edited on trinket.io if python or IDEs can't be installed on the computer.

## Basic Concepts
basicConcepts.py goes over the basics of programming languages (variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc).

## Hands On Experience
For some fun, hands-on experience there is code for a basic game. Look through it, and try to make it better.

### Scrolling Platformer
This is a basic platformer game.  Some ideas on how to improve it:
1. Use an image from the img/ directory (or your own image) to replace the red rectagle of the character sprite.
2. (After #1) Flip the sprite image when changing directions so it isn't always facing to the right.
3. (After #1) Use multiple images for the player sprite (running vs jumping). Switch to the jumping image while the player is in the air (and switch back).
4. Use an image/texture for platforms
5. Create a You Win! screen after the last level
6. Create an enemy that moves in one direction. Add collision detection and a game over screen.
7. Create a floor instead of running on the bottom of the screen.  Add a pit and go to game over screen if the player falls in.
